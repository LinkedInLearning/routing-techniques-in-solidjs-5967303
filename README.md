## Course Description

This hands-on course guides you through the process of setting up and implementing routing in SolidJS applications. Instructor Fikayo Adepoju explains how to implement basic routing, lazy loading of routes, dynamic navigation, and route parameters. Learn to use config-based routing, which allows more flexibility for developers to define routes.

Check out this course to learn the techniques to design navigation for your SolidJS production applications.

## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
